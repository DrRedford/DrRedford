- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrRedford
- 👀 I’m interested in learning  - more about coding and the coding community.  I am just a newbie but I really enjoy problemsovling and troubble shooting!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - I am in college for computer science so whatever is being taught that semester.  I am on a co-op term right now so I am learning Javascript and Deluge (zoho language)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - I'm not sure yet, guess I'll have a look around and find out.
- 📫 How to reach me - Email I guess!
